This is a GitHub repository for Alex Beauchemin's species distribution report as part of GEOS307 - Biogeography and Global Change at the University of British Columbia. Code was adapted from Jeffrey Oliver (2024, https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/011-species-distribution-models.html) and observations were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility with records from 1832-2024 (2025).
